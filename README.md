# odin-recipes
This is the first assigned project after joining The Odin Project . So far , this project is about a working webpage using html . I had to first create a repository on github and clone it locally then after finishing the project , I had it push it to git hub using Vs code . 
The funny thing is I had already made the html pages but I accidentally edited the readme file directly from git hub .
After some  deep thinking , I realised what went wrong and it became a learning curve for me .
